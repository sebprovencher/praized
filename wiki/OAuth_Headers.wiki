= OAuth HTTP Headers =

To authorize a user, OAuth HTTP headers must be sent with the request. Authorization is not necessery for read requests, but in some cases, if they are sent with the read request, more information specific to the currently logged user will be available. All HTTP verbs require authorization excep GET. OAuth authentication is explained in here (TODO link to relevant section).

Here is an exemple of correctly sent HTTP Headers for a POST request : 
{{{
OAuth realm="",
oauth_version="1.0",
oauth_nonce="ae8704c739e3bf6121e40b170583733c",
oauth_timestamp="1220655178",
oauth_consumer_key="DwDSfr1fGfAxfxodqajVA",
oauth_token="9LkIvyTFgm8HtBIWvztNg",
oauth_signature_method="HMAC-SHA1",
oauth_signature="efwVM%2FYAQemNEZyVbfLFFqlnWPE%3D"
}}}
