= OAuth HTTP Headers =

For authenticated API requests, OAuth HTTP Authorization headers must be sent. *These headers are usually created by your OAuth client library*.

For testing purposes, it is possible to setup a simple OAuth proxy to send authenticated requests using tools like curl, see [Testing_cli Testing authenticated API calls from the command line using a OAuth proxy]

Authorization is not required for read requests, but in some cases, if they are sent with the read request, more information specific to the currently logged in user will be available.

Here is an exemple of correctly sent HTTP Headers for a POST request : 
{{{
OAuth realm="",
oauth_version="1.0",
oauth_nonce="ae8704c739e3bf6121e40b170583733c",
oauth_timestamp="1220655178",
oauth_consumer_key="DwDSfr1fGfAxfxodqajVA",
oauth_token="9LkIvyTFgm8HtBIWvztNg",
oauth_signature_method="HMAC-SHA1",
oauth_signature="efwVM%2FYAQemNEZyVbfLFFqlnWPE%3D"
}}}
== OAuth Realm ==

== oauth_timestamp ==
