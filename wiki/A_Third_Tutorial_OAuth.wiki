This page is unifinished

A very useful tool to help understand and use OAuth is available here : http://term.ie/oauth/example/

You can download it and install on your development server to test further. It is available
at Google Code with an MIT Licence : http://code.google.com/p/oauth/

I am going to assume you are using this tool or something similar for the reminder of the tutorial, 
since we are going to have to authenticate ourselves to use other API endpoints.
